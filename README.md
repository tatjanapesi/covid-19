# COVID-19 Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether patients are likely to develop a severe form of COVID-19 based on their health condition and medical indicators.

The objective is to support early risk assessment by applying machine learning models to patient health data.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the likelihood of a patient developing a severe case of COVID-19 based on their medical data.
- **Machine Learning Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest
- **Number of notebooks:** 3  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Model development using Logistic Regression  
  - Model development using Random Forest
- **Dataset:**  
  *The dataset used for this analysis is not included in the repository due to size/privacy restrictions.*

- **Project type:**  
  This project was developed as part of a university course.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tatjanapesi/covid-19.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
  ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the order:

  - **Data cleaning**
  - **Logistic Regression model**
  - **Random Forest model**

4. Provide the dataset manually (file is not included). Make sure to adjust the data path inside the notebooks if necessary.

## Notes

The dataset should contain medical indicators and patient status (e.g. demographic data, underlying health conditions, symptoms).
Since this project was part of academic work, results are for research purposes only.

   git clone https://github.com/tatjanapesi/covid-19.git
